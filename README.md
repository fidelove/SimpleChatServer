# Simple Chat Server

Design and implementation of a chat server for SMART Challenge

These frameworks have been used for developing the backend service:

  1. Spring Boot : framework used to create microservices.
  2. JAX-RS : framework to create RestFull services.
  3. Hibernate Validator : as bean validator.
  4. Spring Websocket : as subscription management framework.
  5. Spring Data JPA with Hibernate: as persistency framework.
  6. Spring Security: as authentication framework.
  7. Lombok: as automatic code generator.
  8. PostgreSQL: as DDBB.
  9. H2 DataBase: as testing DDBB.


These resources have been created:

## User

REST resource in charge of managing the users. Exposes these methods:


1. `GET /api/v1/login`: The authentication method is *Basic Auth*, which includes the next header:

`Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZA==`

This keyword is obtained as this example:
```java
String plainCredentials = "user:password";
String base64Credentials = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(plainCredentials.getBytes());
```

This call returns a cookie, which we will use in further actions:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 
Set-Cookie: JSESSIONID=667B4CDA7E90611C2D54FFCA22D1E52D; Path=/; HttpOnly
```

2. `GET /api/v1/logout`: Finishe the session related to the cookie
3. `POST /api/v1/user`: Create a new user. The body must include this structure:

```json
{
    "userName": "user",
    "userPassword": "password"
}
```


## Chat

REST resource in charge of managing the chatrooms.Expose these methods:

1. `GET /api/v1/rooms`: List all existing chatrooms.
2. `POST /api/v1/rooms`: Create a new chatroom. The body must include this structure:



```json
{
    "chatRoomName": "chatroom"
}
```

All these requests must include the ***cookie JSESSIONID***.



## Message

REST resource in charge of managing some messages. Expose these methods:

1. `GET /api/v1/room/{roomId}/messages`: List all existing messages into the chatroom identified by `roomId`.
2. `GET /api/v1/messages`: List all private messages sent by everyoneone to the user authenticated in the current session.
3. `POST /api/v1/room/{roomId}/messages`: Create a new message into chatroom identified by `roomId`. The body must include this structure:

```json
{
    "message": "message to be sent to chatroom roomId"
}
```


4. `POST /api/v1/user/{userId}/messages`: Create a new message addressed to the user identified by `userId `. The body must include this structure:

```json
{
    "message": "private message to be sent to user userId"
}
```


## Subscription

The Simple Chat Server offers a real-time service that delivers just-created messages. Authenticated users can receive real-time messages using **Web Sockets** technology. In order to do that, these steps must be followed:

1. Open a websocket to the next address: ```ws://localhost:8080/rooms```
2. Subscribe to one of these channels:
	1. ```/queue/rooms/{roomId}/subscribe```: Receive real-time messages sent to the chatroom identified by ```roomId```.
	2. ```/user/queue/private-message```: Receive real-time messages sent to the user in the current session.


Execute the Simple Chat Server 
=======

## Data Base

The only requirement to execute the server, is having a ```Postgres``` database running and listening in the port 5432. The username is ```postgres``` and the password ```postgrespw```.

## Execution


The server can be executed with this command:

```mvn spring-boot:run```

Tests can be executed with this command:

```mvn test```

Finally, load test can be executed with this command:

```mvn jmeter:jmeter```

In order to test the subscription, an html page has been created in the next path:

```SimpleChatServer/src/test/resources/index.html```

There are two initial valid users:

User 1:
```
login: admin
password: password
```

User 2:
```
login: user
password: password
```

When it's opened, this is the webpage:

The dropdown menu has 2 options:

Selecting one of this options, and clicking the ```Connect``` button, real-time messages wil be displayed.
